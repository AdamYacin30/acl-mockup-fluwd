# ACL Mockup Fluwd

## Project Overview
The **ACL Mockup Fluwd** is a comprehensive web project developed using **Bootstrap** as per the guidelines provided. This project is part of an internship assignment aimed at demonstrating web development skills and the ability to create a visually appealing and functional mockup based on a detailed PDF and highlevel document. 

This mockup will soon be used for an AI powered project management product that uses generative AI to create project management artifacts, such as project plans, risk assessments, and status reports, based on user inputs and project-specific data with an intuitive interface where project managers can input relevant project information to guide the generation of documents.

## Project Objectives
- Develop a **responsive Bootstrap-based mockup**.
- Follow design specifications and layout structure outlined in the provided PDF.
- Regularly commit code to a Git repository to showcase development progress.

## Key Features
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Detailed Page Layouts**: Includes multiple pages such as the dashboard, portfolio, and settings, each designed to reflect modern UI trends.
- **Custom CSS**: Custom styling applied to enhance the basic Bootstrap theme and match the PDF specifications.
